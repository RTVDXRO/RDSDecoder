Arduino RDS/RBDS (IEC 62106/NRSC-4-B) Decoding Library

Split off from Arduino Si4735 Library 
  by Radu - Eosif Mihailescu <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro> 3/29/2015

This library is intended for decoding (as in interpreting) an RDS data stream
as received from a broadcast FM radio station. The input is by single RDS group
at a time while the output is a global (accumulated) state record as well as
a callback system for certain types of received data.

In particular, please note this library does not cover decoding (as in framing
detection and data integrity checking) an RDS data stream as received from a
stand-alone RDS demodulator chip.

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/Si4735
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

maintainer at <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro>.
